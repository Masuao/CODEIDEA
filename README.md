# CODEIDEA
Various regions in India are frequently affected by droughts, floods and cyclones. While huge funds are collected from and issued by government, they are rarely used properly. To overcome this problem we propose to build a database which will keep track of the amount of money released from government for relief, number of people affected in an area, food packets released, medicinal help given etc during natural calamities to have a strong grip on the situation and no money is wasted due to unsystematic distribution. Our project will not only help during the calamity but also will help the government to analysis the event so that they can think of a better approach (if possible ) when the next calamity happens. As our project will keep track  of the money used or spent it will help government to have a watch on money left therefore preventing anyone from having fill up their pockets from the money released for relief.
